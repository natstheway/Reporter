# Reporter
This is a reporting scripting which takes nessus files in csv or xlsx and generates different kinds of output

Future plan is to improve it as a generic framework to create reports from multiple tools.

1. Total Number of assets scanned
2. Assets with auth failure
3. Vulnerability summary
4. Missing Patches summary
5. Vulnerability Aging Summary
6  Missing Patches Aging Summary
7. USB enumeration
8. Unsupported Software enumeration
9. Outdated Antivirus enumeration
10. DLP enumeration
11.Share enumeration


TODO : 

1. Logic for most of the reports are ready.
2. Changing the existing iteration logic to row, which is faster.
3. Fixing the charting issues in Word and Excel.
4. Code Clean Up
